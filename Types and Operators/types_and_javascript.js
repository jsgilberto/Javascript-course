/**
  * How JavaScript deals with Types?
  * It's called dynamic typing:
  * You don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds,
  * it figures it out while your code is running.
  *
  * Variables can hold different types of values because it's all
  * figured out during execution.

// Static typing (other language)
// bool isNew = 'hello'; // an error

// Dynamic typing
var isNew = true; // no errors
isNew = "yup";
isNew = 1;

/**
  * Operators:
  * A special function that is sintactically (Written) differently
  *
**/

var a = 3 + 4;
console.log(a);

// in this case, the function name lies between the two parameters (infix notation):
// +(3,4) ---> 3 + 4
// They key here is that operators are special functions, that the JavaScript Engine
// comes with.

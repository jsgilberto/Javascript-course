/**
 * Classical vs Prototypal Inheritance
 * Inheritance: One object gets access to the
 * properties and methods of another object.
 * 
 * Prototypal Inheritance:
 *  Simple
 *    flexible
 *    extensible
 *    easy to understand
 * 
 * Classical Inheritance:
 *  Verbose
 *    friend
 *    protected
 *    private
 *    interface
